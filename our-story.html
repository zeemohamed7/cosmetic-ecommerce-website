        Celeste began with a simple idea: create clean, elegant beauty products shaped by science and designed for
        everyone.

      <h3>Project Vision</h3>
      <p>
        Our vision is to build a cosmetics experience that blends research-backed formulas, ethical craftsmanship, and
        timeless design.

      <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        During this entire project, our group was responsible for designing and developing Celeste, a multi-page
        cosmetics e-commerce website. This project included the following main pages: a Homepage, Science page, Our
        Story page, Making Of page, a Registration Form with full validation, a Product Detail page, and a functional
        Cart page. Being able to build all these elements has helped us put into practice many of the concepts learned
        within this course, including responsive design, JavaScript interactivity, and consistent branding across
        different screens and layouts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Branding was one of the first things we focused on. An early challenge was choosing the right colors and the
        overall design direction, and that was driven by our teammate Fatima. She had come up with a theme called
        Celeste and had chosen a palette to fit the idea of a soft, elegant cosmetics company. We then turned these
        colors into CSS variables so that they remained consistent throughout the website. We also used Google Fonts'
        Roboto font to match our modern style, while the matching hero and product images were created using AI tools.
        That helped all of the pages look visually connected and made the brand feel more professional.
      </p>

      <p>
        A big portion of the technical work had to do with learning and implementing JavaScript. The Registration Form
        required fully custom validation written in our own JavaScript instead of relying on the browser's built-in
        validation. We used regex patterns, length checks, and conditional messages to control exactly how each input
        behaves. This also allowed us to show our own success and error states and avoid automatic validation popping up
        while the user is still typing. We combined these scripts with Bootstrap's validation classes, which took a
        little bit of experimentation to get right. Through this process, we became more confident with event listeners,
        DOM manipulation, and using localStorage to show the user's name in the navigation bar after registration.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also created a Product Detail page and a Cart page, which further pushed us to learn even more JavaScript.
        These features required updating quantities, switching product images, and calculating totals. We picked up how
        to read and reuse code from different sources, which is a useful skill in real development. We also used ChatGPT
        for generating our product images.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the design side, we have learned much more about CSS and Bootstrap, especially how to customize Bootstrap so
        it fits our own brand rather than only using the default look. We used padding and margin utilities to control
        spacing, experimented with media queries as needed, and used the browser inspector to fix layout issues. We
        overrode some of Bootstrap’s default styles with our own CSS variables and classes so colors, buttons, and cards
        fit the Celeste palette. We also added custom favicons so the brand is visible even in the tab of a browser. We
        have also worked with SVG icons for the interface to look even cleaner and more modern. The key learning has
        been how to balance custom CSS with the Bootstrap classes to make the site responsive and branded without having
        unnecessary code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Collaboration also played a significant role in the project. One of the most significant problems was the
        planning of tasks with one another, considering several pages relied on shared components or styling. To handle
        this, we utilized a to-do list and Trello board for task assignment, working progress tracking, and overlap
        prevention in work. This made communication easier and helped us keep everything organized during the project.
        We split the tasks according to each person's strengths—some focused more on JavaScript logic, while others did
        layout, styling, or writing content. The project helped us improve our technical skills in a practical way: we
        became more confident in using Bootstrap components such as grids, cards, navbars, and forms. We learned how to
        write cleaner CSS, with the usage of variables, and also how to debug layout issues. In JavaScript, we got to
        work with validation logic, interactive UI components, and storing data with the browser. We also saw how all
        these elements come together in a real e-commerce website. Overall, this project let us take the ideas learned
        in class and build a functional website. It also helped us improve in team performance: solving problems and
        adapting to difficulties. At the end, we felt more confident both about our technical skills and in team
        collaboration on a real development project.
